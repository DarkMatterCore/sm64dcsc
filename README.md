Super Mario 64 Decompilation Save Converter

This program is designed to convert Super Mario 64 EEPROM saves between the original N64 Big Endian format and the Little Endian format used by many ports for Little Endian CPU architectures based on the SM64 Decompilation project. Usage is pretty much straightforward and it's also explained in the program itself.

This code is of public domain, so just have at it.
